	\subsection{Competition Purpose}
	\label{subsec:competition_purpose}
	As the leading organizations in the aerospace industry such as NASA and SpaceX invest in developing technologies for missions to Mars, manned Martian exploration is now on the horizon. The ability to collect and utilize resources in-situ during these missions will significantly reduce payload cost and creates the opportunity to extend the duration of missions. With the discovery of ice and hydrated minerals in the Martian regolith, excavation of the regolith is of paramount importance to collect water for consumption, hygiene, farming, and more.
	
	The NASA Robotics Mining Competition (RMC) was established to promote the development of concepts for Martian regolith excavation robots. Each team is tasked with designing, building, and testing a robotic excavation system in a simulated Martian environment. The RMC also requires that teams support their local communities by performing outreach events to promote interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.
