	\section{Launch Operations Procedures}
	\label{subsec:launch_checklist}
	Detailed pre-launch checklists have been developed to ensure safety and success in all field operations. For every aspect of the launch field process, a list of necessary hardware and a detailed checklist for the assembly process are included. Procedures on troubleshooting and post-flight steps are also detailed. Safety warnings are highlighted with \textcolor{red}{red} text and required PPE is highlighted with \textcolor{blue}{blue} text. Checklists require verification signatures from all personnel involved. These checklists have been refined with feedback from team Rocketry Mentor Robin Midgett and Graduate Student Mentor Ben Gasser, and their reliability was verified through the full scale test launches of late February.
